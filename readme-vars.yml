It includes a daemon (ldap-auth) that communicates with an authentication server, and a webserver daemon that generates an authentication cookie based on the userâ€™s credentials. The daemons are written in Python for use with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server (OpenLDAP or Microsoft Windows Active Directory 2003 and 2012)."
